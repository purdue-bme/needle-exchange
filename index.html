		<h2> Automated Syringe Exchange Machine </h2>
		<h4> A Purdue BME Senior Design project creating an automated syringe exchange machine. <br>
			Syringe service programs (SSP) present effective means of eliminating bloodborne pathogen
			transmission between persons who inject drugs (PWIDs) by providing access to clean injection
			materials (syringes, sterile water, alcohol wipes, etc.). Yet, only half of the estimated one
			million PWIDs reported using an SSP within the last year, with many PWIDs citing logistical
			concerns as a significant barrier to adoption. There exists a clinical need to (1) increase
			the operational hours of SSPs and (2) decrease the theoretical per-user operational costs. This
			could be implemented by creating an autonomous, remotely-accessible device that provides syringe
			exchange services at all hours.
