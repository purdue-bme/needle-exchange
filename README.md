Syringe service programs (SSP) present effective means of eliminating bloodborne pathogen transmission between persons who inject drugs (PWIDs) by providing access to clean injection materials (syringes, sterile water, alcohol wipes, etc.). Yet, only half of the estimated one million PWIDs reported using an SSP within the last year, with many PWIDs citing logistical concerns as a significant barrier to adoption. There exists a clinical need to (1) increase the operational hours of SSPs and (2) decrease the theoretical per-user operational costs. This could be implemented by creating an autonomous, remotely-accessible device that provides syringe exchange services at all hours.
